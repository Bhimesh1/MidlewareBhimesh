Description:

I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation project leveraging Spring Boot technology. Central to this endeavor was the creation of essential components such as Question.java residing in src/main/java/com/mwt/html/model/, alongside crucial HTML templates including EditDelete.html, delete.html, index.html, and welcome.html within the src/main/resources/templates directory.

Technologies Utilized:

Java: Leveraged for backend development, ensuring robust functionality and efficient data handling.
HTML: Employed to craft user interface elements, facilitating seamless interaction and intuitive navigation.
Dockerfile: Instrumental in containerizing the application, allowing for streamlined deployment and scalability.
Project Overview:
This project serves as a practical demonstration of constructing a Spring Boot CRUD application integrated with a MySQL database. Leveraging the power of Docker, the entire application environment, including dependencies, is encapsulated within containers, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments. This approach not only enhances deployment efficiency but also simplifies maintenance and scalability endeavors.

Key Achievements:

Successfully engineered a fully functional CRUD application, catering to diverse data manipulation needs.
Implemented a clean and intuitive user interface through HTML templates, enhancing user experience and engagement.
Leveraged Docker containerization to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability.
Demonstrated proficiency in Java, HTML, and Docker technologies, showcasing adeptness in contemporary development tools and methodologies.
This project underscores my capability to conceptualize, develop, and deploy robust applications, while also highlighting my proficiency in Java programming, HTML development, and containerization techniques using Docker.
