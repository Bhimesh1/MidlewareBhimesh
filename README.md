I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation project aimed at enhancing data management and manipulation capabilities. This project utilized Java programming language and HTML for front-end design, providing a seamless user experience. The core component, src/main/java/com/mwt/html/model/Question.java, facilitated efficient data handling and manipulation within the application.

Key Features:

Implemented CRUD functionalities to enable users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data seamlessly.
Designed and developed HTML templates including src/main/resources/templates- EditDelete.html, delete.html, index.html, welcome.html, ensuring an intuitive user interface.
Utilized Dockerfile for containerization, enhancing portability and deployment efficiency.
Leveraged Java to build robust backend logic, ensuring data integrity and security.
Technologies Used:

Java: Utilized for backend development and business logic implementation.
HTML: Employed for frontend design and user interface development.
Dockerfile: Utilized for containerization to streamline deployment processes and ensure consistency across different environments.
This project showcases my proficiency in Java development, HTML design, and Docker containerization, while also demonstrating my ability to deliver efficient CRUD operations for effective data management.
